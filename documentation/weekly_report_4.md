9.2 still pushing on with implementation. Now able to decompress huffman blocks.

11.2 Able to decompress test file completely. This file happens to be so short so only "dynamic huffman" mode. Will need new bigger test file.

12.2 Clean up some stuff and documentation. Started writing implementation document.
