25.1
Implemented file reader that reads the header of compressed file and then also returns the compressed data. Also beginning of tests for this part.  
Been thinking about should I implement my own bitreader or use
libraries. For now I'm using library but will see with this one.

27.1
Implemented some helper functions for the bitreader and started with decoding huffman codes.
Also made tests for these.
